# JavaScript & Selenium personal playground

Two setups to compare.

## 1. Mocha and Selenium WebDriver

Using `mocha` and `selenium-webdriver` npm packages. This setup assumes that you have all needed browsers and appropriate drivers installed. Executables should be visible on `PATH`.

## 2. WebdriverIO with Mocha, Selenium Standalone Server and Page Object Model options

Exploring WebdriverIO options. Using `mocha`, `selenium-standalone` services and POM design pattern. Browsers should be installed, but drivers are handled by Selenium Server. Use `wdio.conf.js` to configure the grid.
